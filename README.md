# iss-tracking-system

This Python project tracks the International Space Station (ISS) in real-time and displays the current names of astronauts on board.
Utilizing the **Turtle** module for graphical display and **APIs from Open Notify** for live data, this project provides a visualization of the ISS's live position on a world map. The project also outputs astronaut information in the console.
